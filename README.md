# CODEBOX

Mech 105 Course Algorithms

`CODEBOX` is a repository that contains all of the MATLAB algorithms that were assigned to complete in my Mech 105 course.

The list of algorithims includes:
1. falsePosition ~ An algorithm that uses the false position method to estimate the root of a given function
2. luFactor      ~ A code that calculates the LU decomposition of the array A using pivoting
3. Simpson       ~ This function computes the integral "I" using Simpson's 1/3 rule
